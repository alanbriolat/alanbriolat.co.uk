Universities push for higher fees

My comment on a recent BBC News article `"Universities push for higher fees" <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7946912.stm>`_:

    I'm a university student from a low-income background, and having started my course just after 
    the last raise in fees took effect, I knew from the beginning that I'd be finishing with £32k of 
    debt (including maintenance loan).  While expensive, it's a risk I was willing to take, since 
    it's the best way to equip myself for the field I enjoy.  If this number were to be more in the 
    region of £85k, I think a lot of people would shy away from taking on such a staggering debt.

    The government needs to realise that if they allow such increases, and also increase student 
    loans to follow suit, then they will be footing the bill for allowing the fees to be raised (and 
    therefore passing it on to the taxpayers).  The vital safety net for most students is that 
    `student loans are written off 25 years after finishing/leaving the course 
    <http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/funding_your_study/sources_of_help/loans.cfm>`_, and since 
    the university already has the money, the gap has to be filled from somewhere.  This alone 
    explains the observations leading to "Two thirds believed that fees had not deterred 
    applications from students from poorer families".  If the government wants to subsidise the 
    universities, then they should propose an increase in per-student subsidies as an alternative, 
    presenting the situation as it really is.

    Any attempt to raise or un-cap fees that isn't backed completely by student loans will be 
    disasterous.  This would change the university admissions process to be less "those who are most 
    able" and more "those who are most able to pay".  For a government that campaigned on equal 
    availability of higher education, this would be a step backwards.  In a country with a shrinking 
    manufacturing base, intelligent well-educated individuals are a vital resource for staying 
    competitive in a global market.

    As it stands, I've not heard of universities being severely underfunded, and where they claim to 
    be it can usually be attributed to mismanagement of funds.  If they could survive when we were 
    paying £1150, why can't they survive when we're paying £3150?  It seems to me this may be a case 
    of "they did it once, maybe they'll do it again" on the part of universities, hopeful that the 
    government will grant them more revenue without having to show anything for it.
