Browsing the visitor stats today, I found this little gem:

"Mozilla/1.22 (compatible; MSIE 2.0; Windows 95)"?  Who uses such a browser?  My bet is on it being 
a zombie machine that somebody has completely forgotten about, which would explain the several other 
hits I have from versions of IE before 5.0...  These visitors turn up, hit the same page repeatedly, 
and then leave.  Unfortunately I deleted my spam before seeing this, otherwise I'd be able to verify 
this theory.  Maybe I'll look more closely next time.
